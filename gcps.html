   <p>Good computational practices : working efficiently and reproducibly</p>
   <p>When working in bioinformatics wrong practices can make you lose time, make other lose time or confidence in your
      work, or even lead to disaster. To avoid these you must adopt good habits that include making backups, versioning
      your code and adopting a coding style that will make it more readable for others ... or even yourself when you
      have to read it again a few months later.</p>
   <h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
   <p>The most obvious error leading to disaster is forgetting about backups.</p>
   <p>Please make backups.</p>
   <p>Please make backups.</p>
   <p>The obvious candidate to backup your code is git versioning because it offers several other advantages. This is
      described below. To backup your other files feel free to use any combination of method(s) that best suits your
      needs and preferences, e.g. :</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The ULB provides 1TB of Onedrive storage and 20GB of Owncloud storage</li>
      <li>Personal cloud storage</li>
      <li>Manual backups on external disks</li>
      <li>...</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The IRIBHM mount directory is protected against hardware failure but not human errors. If you rm a file there is
      no trash to get it back from afterwards. You can create an alias for your rm command to make it ask for
      confirmation by default with the -i argument if you wish.</p>
   <h2 id="git-versioning">Git versioning</h2>
   <h3 id="why-using-git-">Why using git ?</h3>
   <p>Regular backup methods are not the most efficient way to handle your code. For instance the iterative development
      of your code might make you think that method B is better than method A. If you do not delete the code related to
      method A your code might become unreadable over time. But if you do delete it you might realize later that method
      A was actually better for a reason you couldn&#39;t envision early on. Without code versioning deleted segments of
      code are lost and you&#39;ll have to do the work twice. With code versioning you can just go back to the commit
      containing method A and carry on.</p>
   <p>On top of code versioning, using github will also allow you to share your code and collaborate on shared projects
      with the rest of the team seamlessly. The commit/backup process can be automated if you wish and pushing to the
      team&#39;s github constitutes an effective form of cloud backups.</p>
   <h3 id="what-is-git-">What is git ?</h3>
   <p>Git is an open source software of distributed version control. It allows to track changes and variants of your
      code and synchronize it between different directories, called repositories. It is the most widely used software
      for version control and it can be freely used and modified by anyone on any machine, whether it is a local machine
      or a cloud server.</p>
   <p>Here is the git project&#39;s web page : <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a></p>
   <p>It is very often used with a cloud-based storage that serve as a central point to share the modifications across
      machines. One of the most popular hosting solution is github, and it is the solution chosen by the team. Github
      allows you to create an account and credentials to access and store your code safely, to create groups (called
      organizations) to share code between multiple user accounts, and to consult your code or any public code on their
      website.</p>
   <p>Here is github&#39;s web page : <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></p>
   <h3 id="how-to-use-git-">How to use git ?</h3>
   <p>To use it properly the best is to follow one of the basics tutorials, e.g. : <a
         href="https://git-scm.com/doc">https://git-scm.com/doc</a></p>
   <p>Please find <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=fr\_FR">here </a>a little game to learn more about
      git.</p>
   <p>Git is already installed on the hyperion VMs, so all you have to do is configure your profile, configure your
      repos (if they are not already configured by someone else), and follow this sequence to share your modifications
      :&#x20;</p>
   <ol>
      <li>git add</li>
      <li>git commit</li>
      <li>git push</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Checkout the tips &amp; tricks sections for example ways to automate this process.</p>
   <p>If you want to share a repository with the team when you set it up all you have to do is to point it towards the
      group&#39;s github page instead of your own. When working with github the preferred authentication method are ssh
      keys, and github has a tutorial explaining how to set them up : <a
         href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent</a>
   </p>
   <p>When you want to pull or push don&#39;t forget that the way you write the repo&#39;s address implies the way you
      want to connect to it. If you want to use ssh you need to copy-paste the ssh-dedicated address, e.g. :
      git@github.com:IRIBHM-computational-groups/container-definition-files.git</p>
   <h2 id="coding-style">Coding style</h2>
   <p>Coding styles are a way to format your code so that it is easily readable and understandable both by others ...
      and yourself down the line. It consists of some very simple rules on the way a variable/function/constant should
      be named, how the code should be commented, etc. To benefit the most from it, the ideal would be for the whole
      team to adopt the same coding styles in order to maximize the code&#39;s readability by the team as a whole.</p>
   <p>Here is the coding style that was adopted for R :</p>
