                  <p>Hello, I am Diego ! I started my PhD journey in September 2023. I achieved a master in Biomedical
                    Sciences at the
                    University of Mons in the Neurosciences and Physiology labs where I investigated the effects of
                    different training
                    conditions on neurogenesis and their relatioship with a myokine called the irisin.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, I contributed to the modeling of an in vitro hypothalamus at the Karolinska Institutet,
                    working under
                    the guidance of Professor Ceccatelli.</p>
                  <p>Next, I pursued a master in bioinformatics at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles under the
                    supervision
                    of Pr.
                    Detours, where I layed the groundwork to histological quantitative trait loci (histoQTL).</p>

                  <summary>Current Research</summary>
                  <p>Currently, I am dedicated to my master thesis project related to the the histological quantitative
                    trait loci. I am
                    exploring the genomic relationships with histology, employing an in-lab developped AI pipeline.</p>
                  <p>My upcoming PhD project, titled &quot;Single-cell Resolution 3D Molecular Histology of Papillary
                    Thyroid Cancer and
                    Adjacent Healthy Tissues,&quot; aims to construct a 3D model of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and
                    healthy thyroid
                    tissues. The project bridges the gap between 3D histology and molecular biology techniques,
                    incorporating spatial
                    transcriptomics, snRNA-seq, and spatially resolved genomics.</p>

                  <p>Hi, I am Maxime. I&#39;m a PhD student in IRIBHM computational biology lab. I have a background in
                    biomedical
                    sciences and bioinformatics.</p>
                  <p>I achieved a master in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Mons (UMONS) during which I
                    contributed to two
                    research projects. For my master&#39;s thesis, in the Laboratory of Metabolic and Molecular
                    Biochemistry of UMONS, I
                    studied of C1qBP functions in healthy and FSHD skeletal muscle cells with a specific focus on
                    autophagy. During my
                    Erasmus internship, in the Department of Paediatrics at Oxford University, I worked on the
                    development of new
                    delivery methods for microdystrophin gene therapy.</p>
                  <p>Then, I achieved a second master in Bioinformatics and Modelling at ULB. During this master I
                    performed a company
                    internship at GSK in the Research and Development department in order to characterize protein‚Äôs
                    antigenic surface
                    attribute. Finally, I performed my master&#39;s thesis under the supervision of Maxime T. in the
                    computational
                    biology lab of IRIBHM where I studied the genome-wide differences in mutability between parental
                    sets of
                    chromosomes.</p>

                  <p>I started my PhD 1st October 2023 under the supervision of Maxime T. I&#39;m currently working on
                    two projects:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>My master&#39;s thesis project: <strong>Genome-wide differences in mutability between parental
                        sets of
                        chromosomes.</strong> Basically, my goal is to find a new methodology to phase the whole genome
                      of cancer
                      patients in order to quantify somatic mutation and structural variants in each copy of the genome.
                    </li>
                    <li>My PhD project: <strong>Characterization of genetic variations in repeated regions of the genome
                        with short-read
                        sequencing.</strong> Basically, my goal is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools to call
                      somatic and
                      de-novo indels and substitutions from short read sequencing data including the non-unique genome
                      (not well
                      characterized), validate the tools apply it to a set of normal and cancer datasets. The final goal
                      is to publish
                      the tool as open source software for the general scientific community and will also make all the
                      calls available
                      for others to be able to mine the retrieved calls.</li>

                  <p>Hello world!</p>
                  <p>I am Dalil, a PhD student and member of the Computational Biology lab at the IRIBHM.</p>
                  <p>I completed my master‚Äôs in biomedical sciences at the Free University of Brussels. Despite being in
                    a bioinformatic
                    lab, my background primarily lies in the wetlab world. During my master&#39;s, I undertook several
                    internships.
                    Firstly, at the ULB Center for Diabetes Research, a laboratory of experimental medicine where I
                    participated in
                    investigating the non-canonical pathway of Nf-KB, specifically focusing on the role of the NIK
                    protein in that
                    pathway. Additionally, I interned at the Jules Bordet Institute, where I worked on deciphering the
                    role of myeloid
                    cells during human cancer development, with a significant emphasis on breast cancer.</p>

                  <p>In my current project, my main focus lies on genomic events occurring during human development.
                    Through a robust
                    collaboration with the Jules Bordet Institute, our current screening involves various aggressive
                    human cancer
                    biopsies. Our aim is to study the occurrence of copy-number events, particularly focusing on
                    whole-genome doubling
                    events.</p>

                  <p>Hello! My name is Oier and I am doing my PhD since October 2022. After studying the Bsc of
                    Biochemistry, I decided
                    to start coding by studying the Msc in Computational Methods in Bioinformatics, both in the
                    University of Navarra of
                    Pamplona, Spain.</p>
                  <p>My Msc project was based on the transcriptomic characterization of different cholangiocarcinoma
                    mouse models and
                    the analysis of different state of the art drug-target interaction methods based on graph
                    methodology.</p>

                  <summary>Current research</summary>
                  <p>Actually, in my PhD project I am trying to decipher the intratumoral heterogeneity in resected
                    PDAC. For that, I am
                    trying to confirm that ] can co-exist in the same patient‚Äôs tumour and could impact therapeutic
                    purpose. To finish,
                    I al studying also the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the treatment resistance.</p>

                    substrates.
                    While ADAR nucleoplasm and cytoplasmic functions are well-studied, little is known about its
                    nucleolar enrichment.
                    My goal is to understand the potential role of ADAR nucleolar location and reciprocally, the

                  <p>Hello, I am Aida, a PhD student student since April 2023. I did my bachelor in Biology 
                    in the University of Extremadura in Spain. 
                    In the final year of my bachelor, I developed an interest in bioinformatics, 
                    which led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven in Belgium.
                    My favorite area of study was the analysis of sequencing data, particularly within the field of cancer research. 
                    To further specialize in this area, I began my PhD at the Laboratory of Histology at 
                    Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Belgium.</p>

                  <p>My PhD project is centered on understanding the malignant progression of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the second most common type of skin cancer. 
                    Through sequencing of normal skin, actinic keratosis (premalignant lesion) and SCC, our goal is to understand the initiation and progression of malignancy leading to SCC, 
                    while defining the different cell-types and cell-states present on each stage of the progression.</p>

                    <p> This would bring new insights, not only to get an effective treatment for SCC but also for the prevention and early diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>Hello, my name is Valeriia, and I am a postdoc at the Computational Biology Lab in IRIBHM.
                    I am originated from Kazakhstan (Karaganda), but all my high education I obtained in Russia starting from Medical Biochemistry in Siberian State Medical University (Tomsk) 
                    and finalizing with PhD degree in biology at Far Eastern Federal University (Vladivostok).  
                    In between I also received master‚Äôs degree in biomedical sciences at the University of Maastricht (Netherlands), 
                    where I was testing the efficacy of a bispecific antibody in inducing immune response against breast cancer.</p>
                    <p> My PhD project was investigating the broad molecular effect of the two single nucleotide mutations in brain tumours (gliomas). 
                      During my PhD I had opportunities to go abroad to learn very interesting methods as single nucleus transcriptomics in the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) 
                      and CRISPR/Cas9-editing by deamination with base-editors in the Dresden University of Technology (Germany)</p>

                  <p>Currently, I am working with Vincent Detours and Maxime Tarabichi on performing spatial transcriptomics on Illumina flow cells with tissue fixed in PaxGene. 
                    This project is challenging as it demands specific knowledge that I never had before, such as how to engrave or cut the glass, 3D-printing of tools for pipetting, 
                    choosing polymeric material sustaining high temperature and still having good thermal transduction, and so on. 
                    I have started my position in the February 2023 and now, one year later, 
                    I have learned exorbitant number of things which are very far from molecular biology (including a little bit of bioinformatics and a tiny bit of French language), 
                    and this is something that makes me feel good about my work. </p>

                    My initial academic background was biopharmaceutical engineering,  with master thesis acomplished at GSK 
                    (Title : High throughput screening of protein formulation stability: Oxidation by metals and light. The goal of the study was 
                    to develop a high throughput screening protocol allowing testing protein stability in these oxidative conditions and finding the most suitable

                    <p> After that, I returned to China for a PhD training in stem cell biology (Project title: Expansion of cardiovascular progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The aim of the project was to find the appropriate in vitro culture condition allowing human cardiovascular progenitor cells expansion and differentiation, without genetic manipulation; and once this step achieved, their molecular identity could be further analyzed) 
                    In 2019 I returned back in Belgium and did master in bioinformatics and modelling (Master thesis title: Computational study of shift work schedules. A non-negligible percentage of population is involved in shift work and could suffer from a chronic jet lag. Based on existing 16-variables molecular model, an organism-level variable core body temperature is added, enabling simulation of shift work conditions varying on shift light intensity, magnitude, direction and rotation speed.) 
                    During this master training, I did an intership under the supervision of Pr. Detours, and worked on a prototype of my PhD project. </p>

                  Passionate about computer science and biology since my youngest age, I chose to pursue a career in the dynamic field of bioinformatics.

                  After completing a bachelor's degree in biomedical studies at the University of Namur, I went on to earn a master's degree in Biomedical Data Management at the University of Li√®ge. My master's thesis was titled "Study of Machine Learning Algorithms Stability for miRNAs Signature Discovery."
                  
                  Following my studies, I directly started working at OncoDNA, a company that provides personalized treatment solutions for cancer patients. After three years in industry, in 2024, I decided to focus on research and embark on a doctoral adventure.
